# Inventory Application

An inventory management app for an imaginary shoe store.

## Description

The Inventory app has categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. All of the CRUD methods for both items and categories are included, so anybody that’s visiting the site can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.

Technologies: TypeScript, Express.js, PostgreSQL.

The task is described at the [Project: Inventory Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-inventory-application) page on 'The Odin Project' website.
